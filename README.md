# Creating a Custom Sound Pack for Minecraft
This guide explains how to create and customize your own sound pack for Minecraft by following a few simple rules.

## Steps to Create a Sound Pack
### Folder and File Structure:

Use the provided folder and file structure without renaming or moving any files or folders. If a file or folder is renamed or moved, Minecraft will no longer recognize it, and the sound will not function correctly.
### Setting the Version and Description:

The pack.mcmeta file contains essential information about the pack, including the description and the version format (pack_format). The pack_format needs to match the version of Minecraft you are using.
To determine the correct pack_format version, check this guide on Minecraft Wiki (https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format).
### Adding an Icon to the Pack:

You can add a custom image to represent your pack in the resource pack selection menu. To do this, place an image named pack.png (in PNG format) in the main folder of the resource pack.
### Optimizing the Pack Size:

To reduce the pack’s size, it’s recommended to remove any files you haven’t modified. This helps keep the file smaller and avoids unnecessary resources.
### File Compatibility:

If a file is missing or incorrect in the sound pack, Minecraft will automatically use the default in-game file, ensuring the game experience remains smooth.
By following these steps and keeping the existing structure of files and folders intact, you’ll be able to create a functional and customized sound pack for Minecraft.
